# Smart Flat-Plate Solar Energy System

This repository contains the design and implementation of an **enhanced flat-plate solar power system** that efficiently collects and converts solar energy into electricity. Our approach improves traditional solar heat collection mechanisms by integrating **smart tracking technology** and **automated steam-based power generation**.

## How It Works

###  1. Absorption of Heat Energy
- A **painted glass plate** absorbs sunlight efficiently.
- A **mirror**, mounted on an adjustable stand, reflects additional sunlight onto the plate, maximizing heat absorption.

###  2. Smart Tracking & Automation
- A **heat sensor** detects the optimal sun angle, adjusting the plate's position via a **motorized system** for maximum energy absorption.
- A **temperature sensor** monitors steam levels, automatically controlling a **steam release mechanism** for efficient power generation.

###  3. Electricity Generation
- The **absorber plate** transfers heat to **copper tubes**, heating water inside.
- Heated water converts into **steam**, which powers a **steam engine** to generate **electricity**.

## Why This Project?
- **Increased Efficiency**: Smart tracking ensures optimal heat absorption.
- **Minimal Energy Waste**: Automated control prevents unnecessary heat loss.
- **Sustainable Energy Solution**: Uses renewable solar power for electricity production.
